        <p>Hi {recipient_name},</p>

        <p>I'm <strong>Siddharth Kale</strong>, a software engineer with a passion for building scalable distributed machine learning systems, leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and developing user-centric products. I believe my experience aligns well with the <strong>{company_name}</strong> mission of delivering exceptional user experiences.</p>

        <p>Here's a quick snapshot of my experience that might be of interest to your team:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Developed AI chat interfaces using NLP technologies like <strong>spaCy, NLTK, Rasa, and Transformers</strong> to enhance user experiences, including building a context management system to personalize responses for users, improving CSAT by 27%. ‚Äî Python, Rasa, Transformers</li>
            <li><strong>Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs):</strong> Built a fully local RAG (Retrieval-augmented Generation) chatbot for knowledge management, enabling seamless interaction with documents. Experience with <strong>LLMs (GPT, Claude), LangChain, and open-source models</strong>. ‚Äî Python, LangChain</li>
            <li><strong>Indian Language Expertise:</strong> Native and Academic proficiency in <strong>Marathi</strong>, with a deep understanding of cultural and linguistic nuances, which is critical for building localized experiences. ‚Äî Native Marathi Speaker</li>
            <li><strong>Classification & Ranking AI:</strong> Implemented automated classification in <strong>Teamcenter PLM</strong>, reducing manual effort by 90% and improving design reuse for 10,000+ parts. Also achieved Top 6% in the <strong>OTTO Recommender</strong> competition with a two-stage system, achieving <strong>Recall@150</strong> of 0.5817 using <strong>LightGBM</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Structures & Algorithms:</strong> Developed a strong understanding of algorithms and data structures, solving 458+ problems on LeetCode, focusing on performance and optimization. ‚Äî C++</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I am deeply passionate about building products that truly understand and connect with users. My goal is to create AI-driven solutions that not only enhance functionality but also delight customers through intuitive and culturally relevant interfaces, something I see reflected in <strong>{company_name}</strong>'s mission with Siri.</p>

        <p>I'm excited about the opportunity <a href="{jd_link}" target="_blank"><strong>{job_id}</strong></a> to contribute my skills and experience to your team. I'd love to connect further to explore how I can contribute to <strong>{company_name}</strong>'s goals.</p>
